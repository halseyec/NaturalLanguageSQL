# Music Database

This database models a simple music service; it tracks artists, albums, songs, and listener playlists.

### Successful Query

**Question:** Which playlists contain songs by Bob Dylan?  
**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT p.title
FROM playlist p
JOIN playlist_song ps ON p.playlist_id = ps.playlist_id
JOIN song s ON ps.song_id = s.song_id
JOIN album a ON s.album_id = a.album_id
JOIN artist ar ON a.artist_id = ar.artist_id
WHERE ar.name = 'Bob Dylan';
```
**Result:** Throwback, Throwback  
**Friendly Response:** The songs by Bob Dylan are included in the playlist named "Throwback".

### Unsuccessful Query

**Question:** Which song would you recommend for listener Halsey Curry?  
**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT s.title
FROM song s 
JOIN album a ON s.album_id = a.album_id 
JOIN artist ar ON a.artist_id = ar.artist_id 
JOIN listener l ON ar.artist_id = l.listener_id 
WHERE l.name = 'Halsey Curry';
```
**Result:** [('Folsom Prison Blues',), ('Jackson',), ('Book of Love',), ('Thats Alright',), ('Gypsy',)]  
**Friendly Response:** I would recommend the following songs for Halsey Curry: 'Folsom Prison Blues', 'Jackson', 'Book of Love', 'Thats Alright', and 'Gypsy'. I hope they enjoy them!  
**Problem:** The query joined artist and listener on `artist_id = listener_id`, which isn't a valid relationship.

## Barriers and Prompting Strategies

I worked on my own database bot for hours, but the zero-shot prompting wasn't successful.
The struggle with attribute access, invalid joins, and non-existent tables was too much, so I used the sample model. 

### Zero-Shot Prompting

Without any examples it returned the top 3 albums by duration and listed albums released before 1970. 
However, it struggled to find playlists with songs by certain artists or suggest songs for a listener. 
It only handled simple questions consistently.

### Single-Domain Double-Shot Prompting

Having examples benefited more complex questions that used
multiple tables. For example, it identified playlists that contain Bob Dylanâ€™s songs and the artist with the most songs. 
But it also joined tables and grouped incorrectly.
